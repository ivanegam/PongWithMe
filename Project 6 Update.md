# CSCI 5448: Object-Oriented Analysis & Design
## Prof. Bruce Montgomery
### Project 6: July 13, 2022

### Status summary<br/>
#### Team members<br/>
Tyler Walker, Ivane Gamkrelidze<br/>

#### Title<br/>
Pong With Me<br/>

#### Work done<br/>
In the first sprint, we
* set up the class structure (Ivane)
* developed the game interface (Tyler)
* added a movable paddle (Tyler)
* added a moving ball (Tyler)
* added a game timer (Tyler)
* added the main menu with the option to start the game, view the leaderboard, and quit (Ivane)
* added a top 5 leaderboard (Ivane)

#### Changes or issues encountered<br/>
So far, we have not deviated from our project plan. However, we are re-considering some of the patterns proposed in project 5.

#### Pattern use<br/>
The following patterns are present: singleton for the game timer and the MVC pattern for the overall game design. The MVC pattern was the natural
go-to pattern for a game. The singleton pattern was helpful in enforcing a single instance of the game timer.

### Plan for next iteration<br/>
For the final deliverable, we plan to have the collision detection implemented and real game scores reflected in the leaderboard.
